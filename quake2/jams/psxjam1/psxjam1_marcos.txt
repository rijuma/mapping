* Changelog *

v1.1 RC4 (06-11-2024):
- Added more visual sugar to the first area to make the looks a bit less bland.
- Added four Flyers that spawn when you get to the top level of the hangar in all difficulties. It felt too quiet between taking down all mobs from below and then climbing with the whole area in silence.
- Tweaked the Quad secret below the stairs to make it a tiny bit more visible.
- Made inner brush from exit door on the shotgun area bigger so it opens when you press the button and removed the "Door opened." message since it wasn't needed any more and it was confusing.
- Tweaked a bit the position of the soldiers in the first floor on the starting area. In some cases they were oblivious to combat that was taking place near them (tweaked the orientation and added an aggro trigger when you are near them).
- Added two flyby cameras. To use them make sure you have "notarget" enabled and run "target cam-01" or "target cam-02" in the console.

v1.0 RC3 (02-11-2024):
- Updated pit area to make it taller.
- Updated some textures.
- Added a few grenades.
- Fixed some path corners on the ship that takes off on the blue key area (now it works consistently).

v0.5 RC2 (01-11-2024):
- Added compass navigation. Not sure if Bots know what to do, but at least the compass knows the way.
- Added a blue light to highlight the big elevator to the blue key.

v0.4 RC1 (29-10-2024):
- Swapped the ugly ladders for lifts on the blue key area.
- Added a few more mobs in Hard difficulty.
- Added a safe jump back to the ground on the blue key area secret.
- Added a secret for Hard difficulty only that's not "actually" a secret (just to scratch an itch, you can just ignore it).
- Added two custom sounds related to the not-secret (please, don't spoil).

v0.3 (28-10-2024):
- Reworked a lift that was preventing some mutants to reach the player.

v0.2 (27-10-2024):
- Updated brushwork / styles.
- Added / relocated some monsters.
- Added boss to blue key area.
- Added Daedalus reinforcement spawn on blue area at mid height.
- Added yellow armor at the end of the "pit" (Hyperblaster).
